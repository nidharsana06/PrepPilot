🚀 PrepPilot — AI Placement Preparation Platform

PrepPilot is a full-stack web application that helps engineering students prepare for technical placements through personalized, data-driven learning. The platform analyzes resumes, tracks coding performance, conducts AI-powered mock interviews, and builds a dynamic skill graph to identify weaknesses and generate adaptive study plans. It also predicts placement readiness using machine-learning models and interactive analytics dashboards. Built using a production-style microservice architecture, PrepPilot demonstrates real-world system design, ML integration, and cloud deployment.

✨ Key Features

Resume parsing and role-specific skill gap analysis, adaptive coding practice engine with difficulty progression, AI-powered mock interviews (technical and behavioral), placement readiness prediction using ML models, skill dependency graph visualization, personalized study planner, performance analytics dashboards, admin panel for managing problems and content, and market-aware skill prioritization as a stretch goal.

🏗️ System Architecture

Frontend (Next.js) → Backend API (Spring Boot) → PostgreSQL and Redis → Python AI Service (FastAPI) → LLM and ML Models.

🧰 Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js or D3. Backend: Java Spring Boot with REST APIs and JWT authentication. AI and ML: Python FastAPI, NLP-based resume parsing, skill extraction models, readiness prediction. Data: PostgreSQL, Redis, S3-compatible object storage. DevOps and Infrastructure: Docker and Docker Compose, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Nginx, cloud deployment on AWS, Render, or Railway.

📁 Repository Structure

frontend for the Next.js UI, backend for the Spring Boot API, ai-service for the ML and AI microservice, infra for Docker and deployment configs, and docs for architecture diagrams and design notes.

🎯 Project Goals

Build a production-grade full-stack system, demonstrate ML-in-production workflows, showcase system design and microservices architecture, and deliver a polished, deployed product for recruiters.

🚧 Project Status

In progress — MVP under development.

🛠️ Local Setup
